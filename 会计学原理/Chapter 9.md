## Allowance Method
At the end of each period, estimate total bad debts expected to be realized from that period’s sales

Two advantages to the allowance method: 
1. It records estimated bad debts expense in the period when the related sales are recorded. 
2. It reports accounts receivable on the balance sheet at the estimated amount of cash to be collected.
