## Determining Inventory Items
Merchandise inventory includes all goods that a company owns and holds for sale, regardless of where the goods are located when inventory is counted.

The special attention include :
- Goods in Transit

- Goods on Consignment
Merchandise is included in the inventory of the consignor, the owner of the inventory. 
Consignee sells goods for the owner, consignor. 
Consignee never reports consigned goods in inventory.
- Goods Damaged or Obsolete
Damaged or obsolete goods are not reported in inventory if they cannot be sold.
Cost should be reduced to net realizable value if they can be sold.

## Inventory Costing Management Decisions
- Items included in inventory and their costs
- Costing method (specific identification, FIFO, LIFO, or weighted average)
- Inventory system
- Use of markrt values or other estimates

## Inventory Cost Flow Assumption
- First-in, first-out (FIFO)
- Last-in, first-out (LIFO)
- Weight average

#### Weighted Average
When a unit is sold, the average cost of each unit in inventory is assigned to cost of goods sold.

\frac{Cost\; of\; Goods\; Available\; for\; Sale}{Units\; on\; hand\; on\; the\; date\; of\; sale}

## Financial Statement Effects of Costing Methods
#### Advantaegs of Methods
- First-In, First-Out
Ending inventory approximates current replacement cost.
- Last-In, First-Out
Better matches current costs in cost of goods sold with revenues.
- Weighted Average
Smoothes out price changes.
#### Consistency in Using Costing Methods
The consistency concept requires a company to use the same accounting methods period after period so that financial statements are comparable across periods.


## Lower of Cost or Market
Inventory must be reported at market value when market is lower than cost.
Market is defined as current replacement cost (not sales price). Consistent with the conservatism principle.
